### Assigning to a geographic area

All contexts were intersected with the geographic areas defined by `r aoi_type` using the `st_intersection` function in the `sf` package `r cite_package("sf")`.

If a context was inside the area of interest but outside of the geographic areas defined by `r aoi_type`, it was removed.

`r data_filter$filter_text[i]`
