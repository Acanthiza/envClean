### Context has any `NA` environmental data

Environmental data was obtained for each context with floristic information using the `get_env_data` function in the `envRaster` package `r cite_package("envRaster")`. This function relied heavily on the `extract` function in the `terra` package `r cite_package("terra")`. 

Contexts that had an `NA` value in _any_ of the [environmental layers](#envDataSources) were removed.

`r data_filter$filter_text[i]`
