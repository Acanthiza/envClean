### Lifeform

Plant lifeforms were assigned in the following manner:

* if a field-based lifeform was available for a record, that was used
* if there was no field-based lifeform, the most frequent lifeform for that taxa within [pca groups] was assigned
* if there was still no lifeform, the most frequent lifeform across all records of a taxa was assigned

This was done using the `add_lifeform` function in the `envClean` package `r cite_package("envClean")`.

`r data_filter$filter_text[i]`
