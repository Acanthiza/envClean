### Singleton contexts

An implicit assumption in collation of the data sources was that records were part of a list of taxa collected within a context (generally a location and time). In many cases this assumption was incorrect. For example, many records in [BDBSA](#bdbsa) of _Eucalyptus camaldulensis_ were at tree health monitoring sites where no other taxa were concurrently recorded.

Thus, any context with only a single taxa was filtered, using the `filter_counts` function in the `envClean` package `r cite_package("envClean")`.

This filtering will have unavoidably filtered legitimate single taxa contexts. For example, some areas of samphire or mangroves may contain only a single taxa.

`r data_filter$filter_text[i]`
