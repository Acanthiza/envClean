## envClean

Cleaning large, unstructured, biological (or `env`ironmental) data sets is a challenging task. `envClean` provides a range of functions to assist.

The approach taken has evolved out of many years undertaking such cleaning tasks. It assumes the desired end result is a plausible list of taxa recorded at space and time locations for use in further analysis. This is _not the same_ as an authoritative checklist of taxa for any space and time locations.

While there are many implied and explicit decisions to make (e.g. there may be a lot of work to set up for new data sets), there is no manual input required once those decisions are made - these functions have the potential to provide an automated workflow from combined data through to analysis-ready data.
